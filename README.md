## 🔄 Workflow

The project's workflow involves several key steps, which are outlined below. Each step is critical to ensure the model is well-trained, evaluated, and deployed.

Update config.yaml: Configuration settings for the project.
Update schema.yaml: Schema definitions for the input data.
Update params.yaml: Hyperparameters for the Elastic Net algorithm.
Update the entity: Define and update the entities used in the project.
Update the configuration manager in src config: Manage and validate configuration settings.
Update the components: Develop and refine components of the machine learning pipeline.
Update the pipeline: Integrate and manage the machine learning pipeline.
Update main.py: Main script to execute the workflow.
Update app.py: Application script for model deployment.

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using three metrics: RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. The evaluation results are as follows:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.7938
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.6568
R-squared (R²): 0.0149

These metrics indicate the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting wine quality.
