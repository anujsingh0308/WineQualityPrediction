## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using three metrics: RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. The evaluation results are as follows:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.7938
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.6568
R-squared (R¬≤): 0.0149

These metrics indicate the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting wine quality.

## Usage

You can access the deployed application at http://13.235.115.149:8001/.

## Concluding Note

Thank you for visiting the Wine Quality Prediction project! I hope you find the project insightful and useful. For any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact.
